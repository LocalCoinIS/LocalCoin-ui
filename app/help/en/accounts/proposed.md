# Proposed Transactions

This is an advanced feature of Localcoin accessible from the send feature. It allows for something known a multisig. Imagine you have a single account but require more than one person to authorize a transaction. This capability is built into bocalcoin, but requires advanced knowledge and there is a setup process. If you haven't previously setup multisig for your account, it's safe to say you do not need it.
